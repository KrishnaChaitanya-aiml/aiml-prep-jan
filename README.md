# AIML Preparation – January (Pre-IIIT Hyderabad Training)

This repository documents my 30-day self-preparation journey for the  
**Student Training Program on AI/ML** conducted by **iHub-Data – IIIT Hyderabad**.

My goal is to enter the program with strong foundations and stay ahead in weekly evaluations, with the intention of earning the short-term internship opportunity.

## Journey Structure
Daily learning notebooks focused on:
- Python fundamentals for machine learning
- NumPy for numerical computing
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Data visualization for insights
- Mini projects and a final capstone project later in the month

Each notebook includes:
- Topic summary
- Implemented code
- Observations & learnings
